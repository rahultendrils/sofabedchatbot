Customer Reviews
Belton King Sofa Bed was delivered on time with white glove delivery.  The sofa and the king bed are both very comfortable and look great in our guest cottage.  Highly recommend! ❤️
The Belton is a heavy, sturdy and beautiful couch that transforms into a very comfortable bed, not your typical sofa bed with the bar in your back. I have the manual option and it is so easy to pull it out. Love it, love it, love it and SOFABED is the best company to deal with! Thank you SOFABED!
Received my Belton sleeper with remote function. For someReason I am not able to upload video. Wanted to show you all how awesome it is. With touch of a button the massive king sleeper can be opened and closed. Thanks sofabed.com for perfect experience.
Arrived way faster than originally estimated. Came fully assembled which is nice. We went with the Gemma 01 color and it’s a nice neutral. The cushions are plush and soft. Very happy with the purchase. Haven’t tested out the mattress yet but seems fine. Cat approved
A stunning power sleeper sofa. Excited to start the lazy winters with the power sleeper sofa in my living room... WFH sorted. The delivery service was satisfying and it looks great with my home decor right now.... I tried pairing it with a electric fireplace, (also purchased on SOFABED.)

I entertain a lot, and having a high-quality sofa bed was a priority for me. After extensive research, I decided on the Carnell Queen Sofa Bed, and I can confidently say it was a fantastic investment. From the moment it arrived, I was impressed by the premium craftsmanship—the upholstery is soft yet durable, and the frame feels incredibly solid. What I love most is how seamlessly it converts from a couch to a bed. Unlike other sofa beds I’ve owned, there’s no awkward bar in the middle or uncomfortable sinking feeling. I recently had two guests stay over, and they both raved about how well they slept on it. The sleek, modern design also makes my living room look more sophisticated. If you want a sofa bed that actually feels like a bed and not just a temporary sleeping solution, this is the one to go for!
I bought this for our family room, and everyone loves it. The kids are obsessed with the recline feature, and the leather is so durable.
